# TeslaLightsElectricDreams
Light Show for the Tesla that plays a remixed version of "Together in Electric Dreams"

# How to run in your Tesla
Your Tesla can run a custom light show if you do the following:

- download folder `LightShow` from this page and add it to your Music folder on the USB drive plugged into the car
- toybox > `Start LightShow` - the lightshow will detect the custom light show and play once the doors are shut.

# Technical Details
The Tesla light show can only run around 350 commands to flash lights, the first version was over 1900 so it had to be simplified a little and the music file shortened.  This file has been designed to run on any of the Tesla's that support LightShow and doesn't use uncommon commands such as opening doors, opening the boot/trunk and I removed fog lights from the sequence when I discovered that only European cars have that command (is this why the UI to turn on fog lights is so difficult?).
